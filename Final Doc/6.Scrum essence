Essentially, Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. Initially focused on software development, it has since been applied to other areas, including research, sales, marketing and other advanced technology areas. A Scrum team suggests a design for a ten-member team that delivers work in an iterative and incremental manner, with each iteration called a Sprint. A Sprint takes no more than a month, usually two weeks.
