Agile is not a set of rules.Agile is not a set of guidelines.Agile isn't even a methodology.Instead, agility is a set of principles that encourage flexibility, adaptability, communication and work software beyond planning and processes.It is captured very succinctly in the so-called Agile Declaration.

Agile software development enables teams to work more effectively when developing complex projects.It consists of the practice of practicing iteration and incremental techniques that are easily adopted and show good results.

In applying Agile to action, we have a variety of agile-based methods to meet all the needs of the software development industry, from software design and architecture, development and testing to project management and delivery.Not only that, agile methods and methods also open a scope for process improvement as a component of each delivery.

Agile is a practical philosophy of software development, which constructs a self-sufficient and cross-functional team dedicated to continuous delivery through iterations and develops throughout the process by collecting end-user feedback.
