### Technologies

The front end is deployed through Serverless and is bound with domain names and gateways. Windows applications are also published. Back-end deployment with Linxu server and Nginx reverse proxy.

#### UI/UX design:

Our UI and UX design team members use Adobe Photoshop and Sketch for prototype and hi-fi design to provide front-end implementation references and automatically generated element style code. At the same time as an important basis for product and back-end design business. Our team collaborated on UI-graph-based design through Blue Lake (online collaboration platform software).
