The existing waterfall technology at the time was too cumbersome to provide no feedback until the final product was ready for delivery.It was called the developed waterfall model because the team first completed one step before moving to the next step.This means there is no room for requested corrections and no view of the progress until the entire product is ready.That's what these experts want to avoid.They want a solution that allows constant feedback to avoid the cost of rework at later stages.That is why agility is also about adaptive and continuous improvement, but also about continuous feedback and delivery speed.
