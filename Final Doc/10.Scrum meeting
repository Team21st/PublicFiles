What work have you done?What do you plan to do in the future?Are there any obstacles to accomplishing your goals?(The Scrum Supervisor needs to note these barriers) After each sprint is completed, a sprint review meeting is held, at which all team members will reflect on the sprint.The sprint review meeting was held to allow for ongoing process improvement.The meeting will be limited to 4 hours. Scrum advocates all team members to sit together, have oral communication, and emphasize the project-related specifications (disciplines) that help to create self-organized teams. A key principle of Scrum is to acknowledge that customers can change their minds and change their needs in the course of the project, and that predictive and planned approaches do not easily address this unforeseen change in needs.
