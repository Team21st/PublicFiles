Over the course of time, we've created several interfaces. From the beginning of user related interface, such as user registration, login, and so on, now gradually derived from the transaction related interface, administrator related interface, the whole system is more perfect, gradually developed mature.
At the beginning of the project, we encountered many difficulties. At the beginning, the connection between the server and the port was unstable, which caused us a lot of difficulties during that time (for example, the verification email could not be sent to the user's mailbox). After continuous coordination with the back end, this problem was improved after a period of time, and gradually completed the user related interface, allowing faster development of subsequent ports in other aspects.
With the increasing number of transact-related interfaces, it is sometimes easy to generate logical conflicts, which requires constant communication and coordination with the backend. After time and time of modification, we finally completed a relatively complete purchase process, from ordering to delivery to confirm receipt of goods, as well as shopping cart function and order inquiry and so on. Every interface added increases the probability of an error, and we need constant testing to ensure that each new interface added does not cause an error in the original interface.
