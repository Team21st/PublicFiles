Agile is one of the most widely used and most recognized software development frameworks in the world.Agile was born on a clear day when 17 people with different development methodology backgrounds, together exploring possible alternative software development solutions that can jointly brainstorm, seeking that may shorten development time and reduce demand for documentation.At the time, software development used to happen so long that when the project was ready to delivery, the business had moved forward and demand had changed.Therefore, even if the project can meet its established goals, it cannot meet its business needs.

So the elites of these different software engineering technologies came together, and the end result of their meeting was what they call the "Agile Declaration."But the agility that was born that day is not what we see in the organization today.The method that experts agree to is called "lightweight" and fast.However, the main outcome of this meeting was the view that faster product delivery and continuous feedback were key to successful software development.

Existing waterfall technology is too cumbersome to provide no feedback until the final product is ready for delivery.This means there is no room for requested corrections and no view of the progress until the entire product is ready.That's what these experts want to avoid.They want a solution that gives constant feedback to avoid the cost of late rework.
