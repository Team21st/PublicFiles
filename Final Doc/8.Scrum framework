Scrum is a process framework that includes a range of practices and predefined roles (a process, plan, mode for efficiently developing software).At each sprint (a 15 to 30-day cycle, length determined by the development team), the development team creates an increment of available (whenever available) software.The feature to be achieved in each sprint comes from the product order. The product order (product target) is the summary requirement (target) of the work needed to be done by priority.Which order item (target item) will be added to a sprint, as determined by the sprint planning meeting.During the meeting, the product leader told the development team what orders he needed to complete in the product order.The development team decides how many orders they will be able to commit to completing in the next sprint.During the sprint, no one can change the sprint order, meaning that the demand is frozen in a sprint.
