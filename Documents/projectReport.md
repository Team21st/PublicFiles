## Introduction to Agile Development (SCRUM)

Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. Initially focused on software development, it has since been applied to other areas, including research, sales, marketing and other advanced technology areas. A Scrum team suggests a design for a ten-member team that delivers work in an iterative and incremental manner, with each iteration called a Sprint. A Sprint takes no more than a month, usually two weeks. The Scrum team focuses on a single common goal at each Sprint, and the developers on the Scrum team review progress towards that common goal and adjust the current plan in the Daily. At the end of the Sprint, the team conducts a Sprint review with stakeholders to review current results and adaptation plans, providing an opportunity for information exchange. Finally, the team conducts Sprint reviews to continue improvement.
